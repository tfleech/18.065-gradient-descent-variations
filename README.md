# 18.065-gradient-descent-variations

This project was for my final in 18.065.  We compared the perfomance of several different gradient descent algorithms.  All the code can be found in classifier.py.  Our training and testing data is all stored in the csv files.  Our final report is in Final_Project.pdf.
